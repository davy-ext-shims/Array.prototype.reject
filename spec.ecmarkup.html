  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    This is the specification for a proposed `Array.prototype.reject` method in JavaScript.
  </p><p>
    It is modified from <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.filter">`Array.prototype.filter`</a>
    in <a href=https://tc39.es/ecma262 />ECMAScript specification</a>.

        <emu-note type=editor>
          <p>
            This method works like <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.filter">`Array.prototype.filter`</a>
            but has opposite result.
          </p>
        </emu-note>
        <emu-note>
          <p>
            _predictor_ should be a function that accepts three arguments and returns a value that is coercible to a Boolean value.
            `reject` calls _predictor_ once for each element in the array, in ascending order,
            and constructs a new array of all the values for which _predictor_ returns *false*.
            _predictor_ is called only for elements of the array which actually exist;
            it is not called for missing elements of the array.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a _thisArg_ parameter is provided, it will be used as the *this* value for each invocation of _predictor_.
            If it is not provided, *undefined* is used instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            _predictor_ is called with three arguments: the value of the element, the index of the element, and the object being traversed.
          </p>
          <p>
            `reject` does not directly mutate the object on which it is called but the object *may* be mutated by the calls to _predictor_.
          </p>
          <p>
            The range of elements processed by `reject` is set before the first call to _predictor_.
            Elements which are appended to the array after the call to `reject` begins will not be visited by _predictor_.
            If existing elements of the array are changed their value as passed to _predictor_ will be the value at the time `reject` visits them;
            elements that are deleted after the call to `reject` begins and before being visited are not visited.
          </p>
        </emu-note>

        <p>When the `reject` method is called, the following steps are taken:</p>
        <emu-alg>
          1. Let _O_ be ? ToObject(*this* value).
          1. Let _len_ be ? LengthOfArrayLike(_O_).
          1. If IsCallable(_predictor_) is *false*, throw a *TypeError* exception.
          1. Let _A_ be ? ArraySpeciesCreate(_O_, 0).
          1. Let _k_ be 0.
          1. Let _to_ be 0.
          1. Repeat, while _k_ &lt; _len_,
            1. Let _Pk_ be ! ToString(ùîΩ(_k_)).
            1. Let _kPresent_ be ? HasProperty(_O_, _Pk_).
            1. If _kPresent_ is *true*, then
              1. Let _kValue_ be ? Get(_O_, _Pk_).
              1. Let _selected_ be ! ToBoolean(? Call(_predictor_, _thisArg_, &laquo; _kValue_, ùîΩ(_k_), _O_ &raquo;)).
              1. If _selected_ is *false*, then
                1. Perform ? CreateDataPropertyOrThrow(_A_, ! ToString(ùîΩ(_to_)), _kValue_).
                1. Set _to_ to _to_ + 1.
            1. Set _k_ to _k_ + 1.
          1. Return _A_.
        </emu-alg>
        <emu-note>
          <p>
            The `reject` function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its *this* value be an Array.
            Therefore it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.
          </p>
